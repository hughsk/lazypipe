lazypipe
=======

Lazypipe allows you to create an immutable, lazily-initialized pipeline.  It's designed to be used in an environment where you want to reuse partial pipelines, such as with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com).

This module returns a function that can be used to start building a lazypipe.  Individual steps are added via the `.pipe()` method.  At any point, a new lazypipe can be built by adding to an existing one, without affecting the previous lazypipe.  Lazypipes can even be used as steps within another lazypipe.

Once the partial pipeline is ready to use, call the last result from `.pipe()` directly as a function (e.g.: `.pipe()()`).

Usage
-----

Install using:

    npm i --save-dev lazypipe

Then create lazypipes like so:

```js
// Example usage within a gulpfile
var lazypipe = require('lazypipe');

...

// initialize a lazypipe
var jsHintTasks = lazypipe()
    // adding a pipeline step, notice the stream has not been initialized!
    .pipe(jshint)
    // adding a step with an argument
    .pipe(jshint.reporter, 'jshint-stylish');
 
// this is OK, because lazypipes are immutable
// jsHintTasks will _not_ be affected by the addition.
var jsTasks = jsHintTasks
    .pipe(gulp.dest, 'build/js');
 
// Create another pipe
var cssTasks = lazypipe()
    .pipe(recess, recessConfig)
    .pipe(less)
    .pipe(autoprefixer);


// now using the lazypipes
gulp.task('jsHint', function() {
    gulp.src('js/**/*.js').pipe(jsHintTasks());
});

gulp.task('build', function() {
    // for example only!
    return gulp.src('js/**/*.js').pipe(jsTasks());
});

gulp.task('default', ['build'], function() {
	// using gulp-watch
	watch('js/**/*.js').pipe(jsTasks());
});
```

You can combine lazypipes in various ways:

```js
// streamA -> streamB
var foo = lazypipe().pipe(streamA).pipe(streamB);

// streamA -> streamB -> streamC
var bar = foo.pipe(streamC);

// streamD -> streamA -> streamB -> streamE
var baz = lazypipe().pipe(streamD).pipe(foo).pipe(streamE);

```

API
---

### `lazypipe()`

Initializes a lazypipe.  Returns a function that can be used to create the pipeline.  The returned function has a function (`pipe`) which can be used to create new lazypipes with an additional step.

### `lazypipe().pipe(stream|fn, args...)`

Creates a new lazy pipeline with all the previous steps, and the new step added to the end.  Returns the new lazypipe.

* `stream` or `fn` - a stream initializer or function to call when the pipeline is created later.  You can provide your own custom functions if necessary.
* `args` - Any remaining arguments are saved and passed into `stream` or `fn` when the pipeline is created.

### `lazypipe()()`  *"Create"*

Calling the result of `pipe()` as a function creates a pipeline at that time.  This can be used multiple times, and can even be called if the lazypipe was added to for other purposes.

It returns a stream created using [`multipipe`](http://github.com/segmentio/multipipe), where all the internal steps are processed sequentially, and the final result is passed on.
